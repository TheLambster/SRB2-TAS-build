This is an SRB2 build made for TASing, this needs to be built using Linux, and you have to use libTAS. This also works with mods/addons for SRB2, including SRB2 Kart.

For the ZIP files, make a folder with the same name as the folder as it tells you to zip it into, and then build it. There are some changes made for TASing, so you can't get the original SRB2 source, if you do, It will NOT work for TASing.

There is also 2 prebuilt executeables if you don't want to tamper with the source, but you are going to have to make them executeable on your machine. For making them executeable, do this command:
`chmod a+x lsdlsrb2` or `chmod a+x lsdlsrb2.debug`.
